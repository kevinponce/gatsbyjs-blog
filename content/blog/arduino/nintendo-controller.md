description: How to use an Arduino as a Nintendo controller
---

Most of the code comes from: `https://github.com/bbtinkerer/NesClassicAdvantage`, but I modified the main to be controlled without buttons.

## Wiring:
```
If you bought after market, the colors will not match.
Instead use the digram, from the perspective of the backside of the plug....
