One small I change I always need to make to iterm is a shortcut to end of line and begining of line.

Do add this shortcut do the following:

Go to: `Iterm2` -> `Preferences` -> `Keys` -> `Key Bindings`

Edit the following commands to be:
```
⌘←  "SEND HEX CODE"      0x01 
⌘→  "SEND HEX CODE"      0x05
```
