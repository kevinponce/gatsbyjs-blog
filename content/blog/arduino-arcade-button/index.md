Arcade buttons are create to use in projects, but are a little confusing if you never used them before.
There are three connections on "COM" and two that are labeled "NO", but what do they do...

"COM" is as an input where you provide 5 volts to.
"NO" is used as the output, and there is two of them because one sends the signal when pressed down and other sends a signal when pressed released.

It is pretty simple, but confusing if you never used on before.
Here is a circuit diagram:
