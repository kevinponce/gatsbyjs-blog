It has always annoys me that I had to use different version managers.</p>\n<p>I recently had to set up my laptop and wanted to use a bash script to do so. I created one for Soothe when I was working there, but never created one for my personal computer. So I did a quick google search and stumbled upon thoughtbot’s laptop repo. As I was looking through their bash script, I noticed asdf.
